Comment First Test  

-For the first test we have an unsafe and unfair simulation with an arrival rate of 1 car per second and a transit time of 2 seconds . 
-Ás it turns out four blue cars are produced in the series and start at different times to cross the bridges because they are of the same type we have no conflict
-At the time of 36: 25: 591, a red car arrives at the bridge, we have an unsafe passage, the car starts its passage.
-Âecause there is a blue car on the bridge while the red begins we have a conflict as it seems.

Comment Second Test 


-For the first test we have an safe and unfair simulation with an arrival rate of 1 car per second and a transit time of 2 seconds .
-Because is a safe proccess there is not going to have a conflict . We noticed that no car starts as long as there is another on the bridge
- The fact that the simulation is unfair is seen in the drive of cars . For example at the moment 57:53:434  a Red car arrived the previous has which is blue one finished at the moment 57:53:498 with a fair simulation it should
  for a red car to start passing but at the moment 57:53:500 a blue car start again to pass the bridge .

- Because is a safe proccess there is going to have a conflict with a high probability and so there is at the moment  04:56:725 when the red car which arrived at the moment 04:56:721  start to passing the bridge 
 while a blue a car is on her.

Comment Fourth Test

-For the fourth test we have an unsafe and fair simulation with adjstument with an arrival rate of 1 car per second and a transit time of 2 seconds .
- Because is a safe proccess there is going to have a conflict with a high probability but against to the great chance we do not have . This is a rare example because needs the oncoming arrival of
  same cars in this case we have five blue cars
- In this example is without meaning the true adjustment value because is unsafe . The high probability of conflict has the effect of ending through the conflict before it comes to some adjustment.

-For the fifth test we have an safe and fair simulation without adjstument with an arrival rate of 1 car per second and a transit time of 2 seconds .
-Because is a safe proccess there is not going to have a conflict .
-Because is a fair process without adjustment the cars  the cars are entering an alternate as it seems . For example when the red car finished at the moment  20:39:844
 the blue car start which arrived at the moment 20:37:760 even though there is a red car in the queue

Comment Sixth Test 

- For the sixth test we have an safe and fair simulation with adjstument and adjusment limit is  with an arrival rate of 1 car per second and a transit time of 2 seconds .
- This test's parametres need for biggest number of cars to allow the adjustment to take place as a result we use 15 cars . However, a snapshot is shown only from the overall execution of the program that serves the purpose
- As it seems at one moment we have 5 Red Cars and 1 Blue Cars  - Cars :   (1 5) - and the adjustment limit is  3  and  the difference is 4  ( higher than the limit as a result program implements a adjustment ) 
  Without adjustment it should pass the blue car but because the program use the adjustment one red car start to passing again .


Other Comments 

if the rate of arrivals is lower than the transit time the unsafe process works without conflicts .



Conclusion 

This file records all the tests that were made with the different combinations of parameters that are meaningful. Altogether 6 tests were performed and commented.
